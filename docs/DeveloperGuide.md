## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a expense).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the expense book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the expense book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### 3.1 Expense Management Feature

As an expense management application, the most important features are to be able to add, edit, view and delete your
expenses.

This section will cover the details of the current implementation and design considerations of
the description management feature.

### Current Implementation

The expense management feature supports six main operations:

* `add` - record an expense, with an amount, a date, a category and a description as fields.
* `view` - view the details of an existing expense.
* `edit` - edit the details of an existing expense.
* `delete` - delete an existing expense from the expense list.
* `add-d` - add a description to an existing expense.
* `list` - list the descriptions in the expense book.


### Expense model

The add expense, view expense, edit expense, delete expense, as well as add description features and delete description
feature are mainly supported by the `Expense` class.

Given below is the class diagram of the `Expense` class.

Fig. Class Diagram for Expense.
![ExpenseClassDiagram](images/ExpenseClassDiagram.png)



#### 3.1.1 Add expense feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding expenses behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddExpenseCommand`:

Fig. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `AddExpenseCommand`
![AddExpenseActivityDiagram](images/AddExpenseActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. Unisave displays a list of existing expenses in the UI, or a sample expense list if the file storing the
expense data is not found.

Step 3. The user executes `add a/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY [t/DATE] [d/DESCRIPTION]` to add an expense.
For example, the user can use `add a/100 c/food t/2020-11-08 d/had dinner with friends` to add the expense incurred on
"2020-11-08", with an amount of "100", a category "food", and a description "had dinner with friends" to the UniSave expense list.
The `AddExpenseCommand` calls `Expense` to create a new Expense object and add it to the `ExpenseList` stored in `UniSave`.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how Unisave processes user request
to execute `add a/100 c/food`:

High Level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `add a/100 c/food`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/AddExpenseSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How to manage optional fields.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Check if the prefix of the specific optional field is provided by the user. If not, add
the prefix and the default value when creating the expense object.
** Pros: Expense always contains the optional objects. No possibility of 0 date object or description object in expense.
** Cons: When setting these fields to default value, it is crucial to use the right default values.
* Alternative 2: Use an `Optional` for optional fields.
** Pros: More intuitive.
** Cons: Harder to manage and prone to error.


#### 3.1.2 View expense feature



#### 3.1.3 Edit expense feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for editing expenses behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `EditExpenseCommand`:

Fig. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `EditExpenseCommand`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/EditExpenseActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. Unisave displays a list of existing expenses in the UI.

Step 3. The user executes `edit INDEX [a/AMOUNT] [c/CATEGORY] [t/DATE] [d/DESCRIPTION]` to edit existing expense. 
`edit 1 a/12` edit the amount field of the 1st expense in the currently displayed expense list from 10 to 12.
The `EditExpenseCommand` calls `Expense` to create a new expense object with the provided fields replaced by the new
values.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how Unisave processes user request
to execute `edit 1 a/12`:

High Level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `edit 1 a/12`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/EditExpenseSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How to allow editing different number of fields each time.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): For every prefix, check if the prefix and a value is provided.
If no prefix is provided, return an error as no change in any fields means this is not a valid edit.
** Pros: Less prone to error. If a certain prefix is not provided, simply use the field object in the current expense
without changing it. 
** Cons: Performance is slower, especially when the number of prefixed is large. Iterating through all and checking
through all of them might reduce the speed of processing the edit command.
* Alternative 2: Check the number of prefix provided.
** Pros: Fast to check the number.
** Cons: Require extra data structure to keep track of the prefixes.


### 3.1.4 Delete Expense feature

#### Implementation

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedExpenseBook`. It extends `ExpenseBook` and stored internally as an `ExpenseBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedExpenseBook#save()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current expense book state in its history.
* `VersionedExpenseBook#delete()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous expense book state from its history.


These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveExpenseBook()`, `Model#deleteExpenseBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedExpenseBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single expense book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/deleteState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th expenses in the expense book. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveExpenseBook()`, causing the modified state of the expense book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `expenseBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted expense book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/deleteState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add a/100 c/Entertainment D/1 d/Movie` to add a new expense. The `add` command also calls `Model#saveAddressBook()`, causing another modified expense book state to be saved into the `expenseBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/deleteState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveExpenseBook()`, so the expense book state will not be saved into the `expenseBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to delete that expense by executing the `delete` command. The `delete` command will call `Model#deleteExpenseBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous expense book state, and restores the expense book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/deleteState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ExpenseBook state, then there are no previous ExpenseBook states to restore. The `delete` command uses `Model#canDeleteExpenseBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/deleteExpenseSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 3.1.5 Add description to expense


The add description features and delete description feature are mainly supported by the `Expense` class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding description to expenses behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddDescriptionCommand`:

Fig. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `AddTaskCommand`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/AddDescriptionActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. Unisave displays a list of existing expenses in the UI.

Step 3. The user executes `Spent on books` to add the description "Spent on books" to the expense with index 2 in the displayed expense list.
The `AddDescriptionCommand` calls `Description` to create a new description object and a new Expense object containing 
this newly created description object, and replace the previous expense object with this updated expense in the 
`ExpenseList` stored in `UniSave`.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how Unisave processes user request
to execute `addDes 2 d/Spent on books`:

High Level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `addDes 2 d/Spent on books`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/AddDescriptionSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How to manage empty description, as description is optional.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use empty string to create description, if description is empty.
** Pros: Expense always contains a description object. No possibility of 0 description object in expense.
** Cons: When deleting the description, the description object is not deleted and "Description:" field is still shown on UI.
* Alternative 2: Use an `Optional` for descriptions.
** Pros: More intuitive.
** Cons: Harder to manage and prone to error.



### 3.1.6 List feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed list feature belongs to `ListExpenseCommand` extends `Command`. This list feature will not modify the expense list of UniSave.
`ListExpenseCommand` is created at `ExpenseBookParser` which is called by `LogicManager` to parse input string into `Command`.
`LogicManager` takes in input string from `CommandBox` which belongs to one of the GUI component.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the list feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. User initializes the app. `ExpenseModelManager` extends `Model`, has a FilteredList of expenses. <br/>
Step 2. After user inputs list command, the steps can be shown from this sequence diagram.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  
`FilteredList` is a JavaFX class that wraps an `ObservableList` and filters it's content using the provided Predicate. 
</div>

Step 3: As we can see from the sequence diagram, a result is also returned to `UI` and shown to the app GUI.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)


### Budget management feature

#### Show Budget feature

The show budget feature is mainly supported by the `ExpenseBook` class.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

Fig. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `ShowBudgetCommand`
![ShowBudgetActivityDiagram](images/ShowBudgetActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. Unisave displays a list of existing expenses in the UI.

Step 3. User set a budget.

Step 4. The user executes `showBudget` to check the current budget.
UI shows the message of current budget and remaining budget.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how Unisave processes user request
to execute `showBudget` when a budget was set:

High Level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `showBudget`.
![ShowBudgetSequenceDiagram](images/ShowBudgetSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How to handle the case when the remaining budget is negative (i.e. current spending exceed the budget).

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Show the remaining budget at negative value, and ask the user to set a new budget.
  * Pros: Expense always contains a description object. No possibility of 0 description object in expense.
  * Cons: Is not supposed to happen in real life, not intuitive.

* Alternative 2: Show alerts when the user is overspending, and does not allow the user to spend more before set a new budget.
  * Pros: No more negative budget, more intuitive.
  * Cons: Much more complicated implementation.




#### View an expense 

The view expense feature is facilitated by the `ExpenseBook` class.

Given below is the class diagram of the `ExpenseBook` class.

Fig. Class Diagram for ExpenseBook.
![ExpenseClassDiagram](images/ExpenseClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism of viewing an expense behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `ViewCommand`:

Fig. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `ViewCommand`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. Unisave displays a list of existing expenses in the UI.

Step 3. The user executes `view 1` to view the details of the expense with index 1(the first expense) 
in the displayed expense list.
The `ViewCommand` searches for the first expense in the `ExpenseList` stored in `UniSave`
and creates a CommandResult which contains the details of the first expense found in the list.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how Unisave processes user request
to execute `view 1`:

High Level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `view 1`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/AddDescriptionSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How to manage empty description, as description is optional.

* Alternative 1: Directly see the expense from the UI.
** Pros: No need to type in any command.
** Cons: May take some time to scroll down the list to look for the correct index, especially when the 
         expense list is sorted by date/amount.
         
         
#### View all existing expense categories 

The view existing expense categories feature is facilitated by the ExpenseBook class.

Given below is the class diagram of the `ExpenseBook` class.

Fig. Class Diagram for ExpenseBook.
![ExpenseClassDiagram](images/ExpenseClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism of viewing an expense behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `ViewCategoryCommand`:

Fig. Activity Diagram for the Execution of `viewCategory`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/ViewCategoryActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. Unisave displays a list of existing expenses in the UI.

Step 3. The user executes `viewCategory` to view all the existing expense category labels 
        in the ExpenseBook in Unisave.
The `ViewCategoryCommand` searches for the first expense in the `ExpenseList` stored in `UniSave`
and creates a CommandResult which contains the details of the first expense found in the list.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how Unisave processes user request
to execute `viewCategory`:

High Level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `viewCategory`
![AddDescriptionActivityDiagram](images/ViewCategorySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How to manage empty description, as description is optional.

* Alternative 1: Directly search for existing expense categories from the UI.
** Pros: No need to type in any command.
** Cons: Takes a lot of time to do so.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* university international students who want to plan their finance
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* spend various currency

**Value proposition**:

1. Problem: spending in different currency not tracked by many existing apps -> track spending in different currency
2. Problem: student exceeds budget, spending without control -> help you manage expense reasonably, save some money at the end of the month
3. Problem: student want to plan their finance, but writing them down is too troublesome -> this app is very convenient to use as users can record their finance any time they want
4. Problem: Student spend at various fields, too messy to record -> the labels functions allow students to organize their spending
5. Problem: Existing apps are complicated, not easy to use -> this app is simple to use and very user-friendly.
